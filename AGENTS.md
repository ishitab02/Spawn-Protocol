# Agent Coordination File

Both Claude Code agents should read this file before starting work and update it after completing tasks.

## How to use
- Before starting work: `cat AGENTS.md` to see what the other agent is doing
- After completing work: update your section below
- Before modifying a file: check if the other agent is working on it
- Always `git pull` before starting
