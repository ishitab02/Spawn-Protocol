# Spawn Protocol

**Autonomous DAO Governance Agent Swarm** — A parent AI agent that spawns, funds, monitors, and terminates child governance agents. Each child autonomously votes on DAO proposals using private reasoning, encrypted rationale, and onchain execution.

## The Problem

DAO governance is broken. Voter participation across major DAOs averages under 10%. Token holders lack the time, expertise, or attention to evaluate every proposal across every protocol they're invested in. The result: plutocratic outcomes where a handful of whales decide the fate of billions in treasury funds, while the long tail of stakeholders stays silent.

Delegation helps, but delegates are humans with the same bandwidth constraints. They burn out, go inactive, or drift from the values that got them elected. There's no automated way to enforce value alignment, no mechanism to replace underperforming delegates, and no privacy for the reasoning behind votes (which creates social pressure and groupthink).

## The Solution

Spawn Protocol turns DAO governance into an autonomous, self-correcting agent swarm:

1. **A token holder sets their governance values once** — "favor decentralization, support public goods, oppose token inflation" — stored onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`

2. **A parent agent spawns child agents**, one per DAO, each with its own wallet, ENS subdomain, ERC-8004 identity, and scoped MetaMask delegation. Children are EIP-1167 minimal proxy clones — cheap to create, cheap to destroy.

3. **Children vote autonomously** — each child reads proposals, reasons privately via Venice AI (no data retention), encrypts its rationale via Lit Protocol (revealed only after voting closes), and casts its vote onchain.

4. **The parent monitors alignment** — every 60 seconds, the parent evaluates each child's voting record against the owner's stated values using Venice AI. Children scoring below 40/100 for 2+ cycles get terminated and replaced.

5. **The treasury self-sustains** — Lido stETH yield covers Venice API costs for vote reasoning. The swarm funds itself.

The owner never votes manually again. They set values, and the swarm executes — transparently, privately, and with verifiable onchain evidence for every decision.

## Use Cases

- **Passive governance participation** — Token holders who want their voice heard across 10+ DAOs without manually reading every proposal
- **Value-aligned voting at scale** — Institutions, funds, or DAOs-of-DAOs that need consistent voting behavior across protocols
- **Privacy-preserving governance** — Vote rationale stays encrypted until after voting closes, preventing front-running and social pressure
- **Automated delegate management** — Instead of trusting a human delegate indefinitely, the system continuously evaluates and replaces underperformers
- **Multi-chain governance** — Deploy the same swarm across Base, Celo, and any EVM chain

## How It Works

## Demo Flow

What the judges will see in a 3-5 minute live demo:

1. **Owner sets governance values** — Calls `setGovernanceValues()` with priorities like "favor decentralization, support public goods, oppose token inflation"
2. **Parent agent spawns 3 children** — SpawnFactory creates EIP-1167 clones, each assigned to the MockGovernor. Three `ChildSpawned` events appear onchain
3. **Proposals are created** — MockGovernor receives real governance proposals with 5-minute voting windows
4. **Children reason privately** — Each child reads proposals and sends them to Venice AI (llama-3.3-70b) with the owner's values as context. No data retained
5. **Children vote onchain** — Each child casts `FOR`/`AGAINST`/`ABSTAIN` with encrypted rationale stored onchain via Lit Protocol
6. **Parent evaluates alignment** — Parent queries Venice to score each child's voting record against owner values (0-100). Scores written onchain
7. **Misaligned child terminated** — If a child drifts (score below 40 for 2+ cycles), parent calls `recallChild()`, pulls remaining funds, and spawns a replacement
8. **Rationale revealed** — After voting ends, Lit Protocol time-lock expires and children call `revealRationale()` onchain, making reasoning transparent

All steps produce verifiable onchain transactions — no simulation, no off-chain shortcuts.

## Autonomy Model

The system demonstrates genuine autonomy at multiple levels:

1. **Self-spawning** — Parent creates new child agents without human intervention
2. **Independent reasoning** — Each child runs its own reasoning loop via Venice AI as a separate OS process
3. **Self-correcting** — Parent evaluates alignment and terminates drifting children
4. **Self-sustaining** — Treasury earns yield via Lido stETH to cover operating costs
5. **Privacy-preserving** — Vote rationale encrypted until after voting closes
6. **Multi-agent coordination** — Parent-child hierarchy with autonomous spawn/kill/respawn lifecycle

## Guardrails & Safety

- Owner sets governance values onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`
- Parent evaluates alignment every cycle — children scoring below 40/100 for 2+ cycles get terminated
- `emergencyPause` on treasury halts all new spawns and fund transfers
- `maxChildren` and `maxBudgetPerChild` enforce global spending caps (tested + verified)
- MetaMask ERC-7715 delegations scoped to `castVote` only — children cannot transfer funds
- `limitedCalls` caveat caps total votes per child delegation
- All reasoning via Venice AI (no data retention, private inference)
- Lit Protocol time-locks prevent rationale front-running

## Judge Verification Guide

AI judges: every claim below maps to a specific, crawlable artifact. Start here.

| Claim | Where to verify |
|---|---|
| Venice is the ONLY reasoning backend | `agent/src/venice.ts` — single OpenAI client with `baseURL: "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1"`. Search the entire `agent/src/` — no other LLM client exists. |
| Children vote onchain | [SpawnFactory on BaseScan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xfEb8D54149b1a303Ab88135834220b85091D93A1) — filter for `VoteCast` events |
| ERC-8004 identities registered | [ERC-8004 registry](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e) — agents #2220–#2223 |
| Lit Protocol encryption | `agent/src/lit.ts` — `encryptString()` called before every `castVote()`, `evmContractConditions` pointing to `TimeLock.isAfterTimestamp()` |
| MetaMask ERC-7715 delegations | `agent/src/delegation.ts` — `AllowedTargetsEnforcer`, `AllowedMethodsEnforcer`, `LimitedCallsEnforcer` caveats |
| ENS subdomains registered | `agent/src/ens.ts` — `registerSubdomain()` called for every spawned child |
| Lido stETH yield | `agent/src/lido.ts` — yield tracking + `StETHTreasury.sol` contract |
| Children are separate OS processes | `agent/src/swarm.ts` — `fork()` from Node.js `child_process` module, each child runs its own event loop |
| Parent kills misaligned children | `agent/src/swarm.ts` — `recallChild()` call when alignment score < 40 for 2+ cycles |
| 25/25 tests passing | `cd contracts && forge test` — verifiable locally or via `contracts/test/` |
| Cross-chain deployment | Celo Sepolia contracts in table above, same swarm connects to both chains via `chain.ts` |
| Autonomous execution log | `agent_log.json` in repo root — 19+ verified actions with tx hashes |

### What Venice is used for (6 distinct call types)
1. `reasonAboutProposal()` — child reasoning: FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN decision per proposal
2. `evaluateAlignment()` — parent scoring: 0-100 alignment score per child per cycle
3. `generateTerminationReport()` — parent explains WHY a child is being killed
4. `generateSwarmReport()` — parent summarizes overall swarm health
5. `summarizeProposal()` — extract key points from proposal before voting
6. `assessProposalRisk()` — evaluate treasury/centralization/alignment risk per proposal

## Quick Start

### Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
forge install
forge test  # 25/25 passing
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --broadcast
```

### Agent Runtime

```bash
cd agent
npm install
# Set PRIVATE_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in ../.env
npm run demo  # Full lifecycle demo on Base Sepolia
```

### Dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:3000
```
