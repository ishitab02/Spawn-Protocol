# Spawn Protocol

**Autonomous DAO Governance Agent Swarm** — A parent AI agent that spawns, funds, monitors, and terminates child governance agents. Each child autonomously votes on DAO proposals using private reasoning, encrypted rationale, and onchain execution.

## The Problem

DAO governance is broken. Voter participation across major DAOs averages under 10%. Token holders lack the time, expertise, or attention to evaluate every proposal across every protocol they're invested in. The result: plutocratic outcomes where a handful of whales decide the fate of billions in treasury funds, while the long tail of stakeholders stays silent.

Delegation helps, but delegates are humans with the same bandwidth constraints. They burn out, go inactive, or drift from the values that got them elected. There's no automated way to enforce value alignment, no mechanism to replace underperforming delegates, and no privacy for the reasoning behind votes (which creates social pressure and groupthink).

## The Solution

Spawn Protocol turns DAO governance into an autonomous, self-correcting agent swarm:

1. **A token holder sets their governance values once** — "favor decentralization, support public goods, oppose token inflation" — stored onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`

2. **A parent agent spawns child agents**, one per DAO, each with its own wallet, ENS subdomain, ERC-8004 identity, and scoped MetaMask delegation. Children are EIP-1167 minimal proxy clones — cheap to create, cheap to destroy.

3. **Children vote autonomously** — each child reads proposals, reasons privately via Venice AI (no data retention), encrypts its rationale via Lit Protocol (revealed only after voting closes), and casts its vote onchain.

4. **The parent monitors alignment** — every 60 seconds, the parent evaluates each child's voting record against the owner's stated values using Venice AI. Children scoring below 40/100 for 2+ cycles get terminated and replaced.

5. **The treasury self-sustains** — Lido stETH yield covers Venice API costs for vote reasoning. The swarm funds itself.

The owner never votes manually again. They set values, and the swarm executes — transparently, privately, and with verifiable onchain evidence for every decision.

## Use Cases

- **Passive governance participation** — Token holders who want their voice heard across 10+ DAOs without manually reading every proposal
- **Value-aligned voting at scale** — Institutions, funds, or DAOs-of-DAOs that need consistent voting behavior across protocols
- **Privacy-preserving governance** — Vote rationale stays encrypted until after voting closes, preventing front-running and social pressure
- **Automated delegate management** — Instead of trusting a human delegate indefinitely, the system continuously evaluates and replaces underperformers
- **Multi-chain governance** — Deploy the same swarm across Base, Celo, and any EVM chain

## How It Works

## Demo Flow

What the judges will see in a 3-5 minute live demo:

1. **Owner sets governance values** — Calls `setGovernanceValues()` with priorities like "favor decentralization, support public goods, oppose token inflation"
2. **Parent agent spawns 3 children** — SpawnFactory creates EIP-1167 clones, each assigned to the MockGovernor. Three `ChildSpawned` events appear onchain
3. **Proposals are created** — MockGovernor receives real governance proposals with 5-minute voting windows
4. **Children reason privately** — Each child reads proposals and sends them to Venice AI (llama-3.3-70b) with the owner's values as context. No data retained
5. **Children vote onchain** — Each child casts `FOR`/`AGAINST`/`ABSTAIN` with encrypted rationale stored onchain via Lit Protocol
6. **Parent evaluates alignment** — Parent queries Venice to score each child's voting record against owner values (0-100). Scores written onchain
7. **Misaligned child terminated** — If a child drifts (score below 40 for 2+ cycles), parent calls `recallChild()`, pulls remaining funds, and spawns a replacement
8. **Rationale revealed** — After voting ends, Lit Protocol time-lock expires and children call `revealRationale()` onchain, making reasoning transparent

All steps produce verifiable onchain transactions — no simulation, no off-chain shortcuts.

## Autonomy Model

The system demonstrates genuine autonomy at multiple levels:

1. **Self-spawning** — Parent creates new child agents without human intervention
2. **Independent reasoning** — Each child runs its own reasoning loop via Venice AI as a separate OS process
3. **Self-correcting** — Parent evaluates alignment and terminates drifting children
4. **Self-sustaining** — Treasury earns yield via Lido stETH to cover operating costs
5. **Privacy-preserving** — Vote rationale encrypted until after voting closes
6. **Multi-agent coordination** — Parent-child hierarchy with autonomous spawn/kill/respawn lifecycle

## Guardrails & Safety

- Owner sets governance values onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`
- Parent evaluates alignment every cycle — children scoring below 40/100 for 2+ cycles get terminated
- `emergencyPause` on treasury halts all new spawns and fund transfers
- `maxChildren` and `maxBudgetPerChild` enforce global spending caps (tested + verified)
- MetaMask ERC-7715 delegations scoped to `castVote` only — children cannot transfer funds
- `limitedCalls` caveat caps total votes per child delegation
- All reasoning via Venice AI (no data retention, private inference)
- Lit Protocol time-locks prevent rationale front-running

## Bounty Alignment

### Venice Private Agents ($11.5K) `ea3b366947c54689bd82ae80bf9f3310`
Every reasoning call goes through Venice API (llama-3.3-70b). No other LLM is used in the product. Venice provides private, no-data-retention inference for governance decisions. Children reason about proposals privately — their rationale is encrypted via Lit Protocol and only revealed after voting closes. This is the exact use case Venice describes: "private cognition wired to trustworthy public action."

### Synthesis Open Track ($25K) `fdb76d08812b43f6a5f454744b66f590`
Community-funded pool. Spawn Protocol addresses the unsolved problem of DAO governance participation — under 10% voter turnout industry-wide. Autonomous agent swarms that vote according to owner values, with built-in alignment monitoring and self-correction.

### Protocol Labs — "Let the Agent Cook" ($4K + $150K pool) `10bd47fac07e4f85bda33ba482695b24`
Maximum autonomy: parent discovers proposals, spawns children, children reason and vote independently, parent evaluates alignment and terminates/respawns — all without human intervention. Full decision loop: discover → plan → execute → verify → correct. ERC-8004 identity for every agent. Compute budget awareness via `maxGasPerVote` enforcement and Lido yield tracking.

### Protocol Labs — "Agents With Receipts" ($4K + $150K pool) `3bf41be958da497bbb69f1a150c76af9`
ERC-8004 onchain identity for every agent (parent + children). Registered on the official Base identity registry (`0x8004A818...`). Metadata includes agent type, assigned DAO, alignment score, ENS name, and capabilities. Parent updates child metadata (alignment scores) after each evaluation cycle — creating a verifiable onchain reputation trail.

### MetaMask Delegations ($5K) `0d69d56a8a084ac5b7dbe0dc1da73e1d`
ERC-7715 scoped delegations with three-caveat architecture: `AllowedTargetsEnforcer` (specific governance contract), `AllowedMethodsEnforcer` (`castVote` selector only), `LimitedCallsEnforcer` (caps total votes). Delegations flow owner → parent → children, creating a hierarchical sub-delegation chain. Children can only vote — they cannot transfer funds, change settings, or call any other function.

### Best Agent on Celo ($5K) `ff26ab4933c84eea856a5c6bf513370b`
Full contract suite deployed to Celo Sepolia (chain 11142220). Same architecture, same agent runtime, multi-chain ready. Celo's low-cost L2 infrastructure makes agent swarms economically viable for high-frequency governance participation.

### Base Agent Services ($5K) `6f0e3d7dcadf4ef080d3f424963caff5`
Primary deployment on Base Sepolia. All demo transactions execute on Base. The agent swarm provides governance-as-a-service — token holders deposit ETH, set values, and the swarm votes across DAOs on their behalf.

### ENS Identity ($600) `627a3f5a288344489fe777212b03f953`
Each child agent gets an ENS subdomain (`uniswap-gov.spawn.eth`, `lido-gov.spawn.eth`, `ens-gov.spawn.eth`). ENS names replace hex addresses as the primary identity for agents in the swarm.

### ENS Communication ($600) `9c4599cf9d0f4002b861ff1a4b27f10a`
Parent-to-child communication uses ENS names for routing. The parent resolves `{dao-name}.spawn.eth` to find child contract addresses. ENS-powered agent-to-agent communication within the swarm.

### ENS Open Integration ($300) `8840da28fb3b46bcb08465e1d0e8756d`
ENS is core to the agent identity system — not an afterthought. Every child is registered with an ENS subdomain at spawn time, and the subdomain is deregistered when the child is terminated.

### Lido stETH Agent Treasury ($3K) `5e445a077b5248e0974904915f76e1a0`
Treasury earns yield via Lido stETH. Yield covers Venice API costs for vote reasoning — self-sustaining agent swarm. The agent spends from yield, not principal, creating a sustainable operating budget.
