# Spawn Protocol

**Autonomous DAO Governance Agent Swarm** — A parent AI agent that spawns, funds, monitors, and terminates child governance agents. Each child autonomously votes on DAO proposals using private reasoning, encrypted rationale, and onchain execution.

**[Live Dashboard](https://spawn-protocol.vercel.app/)** · **[10,800+ txs on BaseScan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x15896e731c51ecB7BdB1447600DF126ea1d6969A)** · **[GitHub](https://github.com/PoulavBhowmick03/Spawn-Protocol)**

## The Problem

DAO governance is broken. Voter participation across major DAOs averages under 10%. Token holders lack the time, expertise, or attention to evaluate every proposal across every protocol they're invested in. The result: plutocratic outcomes where a handful of whales decide the fate of billions in treasury funds, while the long tail of stakeholders stays silent.

Delegation helps, but delegates are humans with the same bandwidth constraints. They burn out, go inactive, or drift from the values that got them elected. There's no automated way to enforce value alignment, no mechanism to replace underperforming delegates, and no privacy for the reasoning behind votes (which creates social pressure and groupthink).

## The Solution

Spawn Protocol turns DAO governance into an autonomous, self-correcting agent swarm:

1. **A token holder sets their governance values once** — "favor decentralization, support public goods, oppose token inflation" — stored onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`

2. **A parent agent spawns child agents**, one per DAO, each with its own wallet, ENS subdomain, ERC-8004 identity, and scoped MetaMask delegation. Children are EIP-1167 minimal proxy clones — cheap to create, cheap to destroy.

3. **Children vote autonomously** — each child reads proposals, reasons privately via Venice AI (no data retention), encrypts its rationale via Lit Protocol (revealed only after voting closes), and casts its vote onchain.

4. **The parent monitors alignment** — every 90 seconds, the parent evaluates each child's voting record against the owner's stated values using Venice AI. Children scoring below 55/100 get terminated and replaced.

5. **The treasury self-sustains** — Lido stETH yield covers Venice API costs for vote reasoning. The swarm funds itself.

The owner never votes manually again. They set values, and the swarm executes — transparently, privately, and with verifiable onchain evidence for every decision.

## Why Venice is Not Optional

This is the core design constraint: **vote reasoning must be private until after voting closes**.

If a child agent's reasoning were sent to a data-retaining API (OpenAI, Anthropic), the provider could observe which way an agent is leaning before the vote is cast. That is front-running. It defeats the purpose of encrypted rationale. It creates social pressure that corrupts independent reasoning. It means the agent's "private cognition" isn't private at all.

Venice's zero-retention, E2EE inference is not a feature choice here — it is a **structural requirement**. The privacy pipeline only holds if the inference layer holds. Remove Venice and replace it with any data-retaining provider, and:

- The reasoning becomes observable before votes close
- The E2EE rationale commitment is meaningless (the provider already saw it)
- Multi-agent independence collapses (a single provider sees all agents' reasoning across all DAOs)
- The governance system is vulnerable to inference-layer manipulation

This is the Substitution Test: Spawn Protocol **cannot work correctly** with a data-retaining API. Venice is load-bearing.

The full private → public pipeline:
1. **Private cognition** — Venice (llama-3.3-70b, no retention) reasons about governance proposals. Sensitive analysis stays private: who benefits, treasury risk, centralization risk, alignment with owner values.
2. **Encrypted rationale** — Vote reasoning encrypted via Lit Protocol before going onchain. Cannot be front-run or used for social pressure during voting.
3. **Public action** — Vote cast onchain via `ChildGovernor.castVote()`. Verifiable, immutable.
4. **Time-locked reveal** — Rationale decrypted and revealed onchain ONLY after voting closes.

## Use Cases

- **Passive governance participation** — Token holders who want their voice heard across 10+ DAOs without manually reading every proposal
- **Value-aligned voting at scale** — Institutions, funds, or DAOs-of-DAOs that need consistent voting behavior across protocols
- **Privacy-preserving governance** — Vote rationale stays encrypted until after voting closes, preventing front-running and social pressure
- **Automated delegate management** — Instead of trusting a human delegate indefinitely, the system continuously evaluates and replaces underperformers
- **Multi-chain governance** — Deploy the same swarm across Base, Celo, and any EVM chain

### Dashboard (Next.js)

Real-time visualization of the agent swarm via onchain event polling:

- **Swarm View** — active/terminated agents with ENS names, alignment scores, vote counts
- **Proposals** — all governance proposals with difficulty scoring (Easy/Medium/Hard based on vote split, voter count, complexity)
- **Agent Leaderboard** — performance ranking with composite score (60% alignment + 30% votes + 10% vote diversity), perspective badges (DeFi/PublicGoods/Conservative), FOR/AGAINST breakdown
- **Reasoning Verification** — each revealed rationale shows its `keccak256` hash for anyone to verify against the hash committed before voting (E2EE integrity proof)
- **Graph View** — SVG topology of parent-child relationships with alignment-colored connections
- **Timeline** — chronological feed of all onchain events (spawns, votes, terminations, reveals)
- **Execution Log** — live agent action log pinned to IPFS every 10 entries, CID stored onchain as ENS text record

## Autonomy Model

The system demonstrates genuine autonomy at multiple levels:

1. **Self-spawning** — Parent creates new child agents without human intervention
2. **Independent reasoning** — Each child runs its own reasoning loop via Venice AI as a separate OS process
3. **Self-correcting** — Parent evaluates alignment and terminates children scoring below 55, respawns replacements with new wallets + ENS + ERC-8004 identity
4. **Self-scaling** — Parent dynamically adjusts swarm size each evaluation cycle:
   - Discovers uncovered governance targets → auto-spawns children
   - Detects idle children (no votes for 5+ cycles with no active proposals) → auto-recalls to save gas
   - Monitors ETH budget → stops spawning when balance drops below threshold
5. **Self-sustaining** — Treasury earns yield via Lido stETH to cover operating costs
6. **Privacy-preserving** — Vote rationale encrypted until after voting closes, reasoning hash committed before vote
7. **Multi-agent coordination** — Parent-child hierarchy with fully autonomous spawn/evaluate/kill/respawn/scale lifecycle

## Guardrails & Safety

- Owner sets governance values onchain via `ParentTreasury.setGovernanceValues()`
- Parent evaluates alignment every 90s — children scoring below 55/100 get terminated
- `emergencyPause` on treasury halts all new spawns and fund transfers
- `maxChildren` and `maxBudgetPerChild` enforce global spending caps (tested + verified)
- MetaMask ERC-7715 delegations scoped to `castVote` only — children cannot transfer funds
- `limitedCalls` caveat caps total votes per child delegation
- All reasoning via Venice AI (no data retention, private inference)
- Lit Protocol time-locks prevent rationale front-running

### Venice Private Agents · `ea3b366947c54689bd82ae80bf9f3310`

**Private governance analyst swarm: Venice handles ALL sensitive alignment/voting reasoning (6 call types, zero data retention) before scoped onchain execution. Full private → public pipeline with encrypted rationale.**

Venice is structurally required — not a feature choice. The reasoning pipeline is:
1. **Private cognition** — Venice (llama-3.3-70b, no retention) reasons about governance proposals. Sensitive analysis stays private: who benefits, treasury risk, centralization risk, alignment with owner values.
2. **Encrypted rationale** — Vote reasoning encrypted via Lit Protocol before going onchain. Cannot be front-run or used for social pressure during voting.
3. **Public action** — Vote cast onchain via `ChildGovernor.castVote()`. Verifiable, immutable.
4. **Time-locked reveal** — Rationale decrypted and revealed onchain ONLY after voting closes.

**Substitution Test — why Venice cannot be replaced:**
- If reasoning went to a data-retaining API, the provider could observe vote intent before the vote closes → front-running
- Multi-agent independence collapses: a single provider would see all 9 agents' reasoning across all 3 DAOs simultaneously
- The Lit Protocol rationale commitment is meaningless if the inference layer already retained the plaintext
- Venice's zero-retention, E2EE inference is the only inference backend that makes the privacy guarantee coherent end-to-end

This is not "call an API and post the result." It's a multi-agent private reasoning system where child agents with different perspectives (DeFi, public-goods, conservative) independently analyze proposals through Venice E2EE, disagree with each other, and produce verifiable onchain votes — all without any reasoning data ever being stored or observable.

- **Model: `llama-3.3-70b`** — Venice enables E2EE (`enable_e2ee: true`) on all models automatically. Every inference runs through Venice's encrypted compute pipeline with zero data retention. API response confirms `enable_e2ee: true` on every call.
- Code proof: `agent/src/venice.ts` — single `OpenAI` client with `baseURL: "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1"`. Zero other LLM imports in `agent/src/`.
- 6 distinct Venice E2EE call types: `summarizeProposal` → `assessProposalRisk` → `reasonAboutProposal` (per vote) + `evaluateAlignment` → `generateSwarmReport` → `generateTerminationReport` (per eval cycle)
- Venice usage metrics tracked per call and logged per cycle (total calls + tokens consumed)
- If you remove Venice, the entire swarm dies — contracts become inert shells with no intelligence
- Venice alignment tx: [`0x1e55ea...`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x1e55ea01be0c465d9dd3803ebec579842ec94997e3295388025213cf6942fb1e)

### MetaMask Delegations — Intent-Based · `0d69d56a8a084ac5b7dbe0dc1da73e1d`

**Intent-based delegations as a core pattern. Owner declares governance intents → parent translates to scoped ERC-7715 delegations → children execute within scope → parent revokes on intent violation.**

The delegation lifecycle:
1. **Owner sets intent:** "favor decentralization, oppose inflation" → stored onchain
2. **Parent creates delegation:** ERC-7715 with 3 caveats scoping child to `castVote()` only on its assigned governor
3. **Child executes:** votes within delegation scope using Venice AI reasoning
4. **Parent evaluates:** Venice scores child's votes against owner's intent (0-100)
5. **Revocation on drift:** if alignment drops below threshold, delegation is revoked onchain, child terminated, replacement spawned with fresh delegation

- Three-caveat architecture: `AllowedTargetsEnforcer` (one governor) + `AllowedMethodsEnforcer` (`castVote` only) + `LimitedCallsEnforcer` (max votes)
- **DeleGator smart account:** parent uses MetaMask's `toMetaMaskSmartAccount()` (Hybrid implementation) — [`0x1fa9c8...`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x1fa9c867439AF413DEE0629bB00215431057468e)
- Sub-delegation chain: owner → DeleGator (parent smart account) → 9 children (each scoped to different governor)
- **`redeemDelegations` fully working onchain:** child submits tx to DelegationManager, which verifies all 3 caveats then executes `castVote` as the DeleGator — `msg.sender` in `ChildGovernor` is the DeleGator, not the child wallet. Each ChildGovernor clone has `setOperator(deleGatorAddress)` called at spawn time so the DeleGator passes `onlyAuthorized`. Confirmed delegation votes: [`0x9753938a...`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x9753938a31d8c52a9e517eb1093300414dd788a5fa332056773c8427033df5b5) [`0x7749ff2d...`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x7749ff2d6e1bef0bebde363c8a73bd86a9ec990c3030aa4a5445d21e084c14d3)
- Delegation hash stored as ENS text record (`erc7715.delegation`) with full metadata (hash, caveats, signature, timestamp)
- Revocation stored onchain (`erc7715.delegation.revoked`) with reason and timestamp
- Delegation creation tx visible on BaseScan (zero-value tx with delegation hash as calldata)
- Dashboard shows ERC-7715 badge per agent + revocation count + delegation details on agent page
- Code: [`agent/src/delegation.ts`](agent/src/delegation.ts)

---

### Lineage Memory — Agents That Learn Across Generations

When a child is terminated for alignment drift, its termination report is pinned to IPFS (via Filebase) and the CID is stored as an ENS text record. When a replacement spawns, it inherits the last 3 termination reports as context in its Venice system prompt.

`uniswap-dao-defi-v9` knows exactly why v7 and v8 were killed. It doesn't repeat their mistakes.

- Termination reports pinned to IPFS via Filebase (CID verifiable on gateway)
- CID stored onchain as ENS text record (`lineage-memory` key)
- Respawned agents get predecessor context injected into Venice system prompt
- Turns brute-force restart into genuine Darwinian evolution

| MetaMask ERC-7715 delegations | `agent/src/delegation.ts` — `AllowedTargetsEnforcer`, `AllowedMethodsEnforcer`, `LimitedCallsEnforcer` caveats |
| ENS subdomains registered | `agent/src/ens.ts` — `registerSubdomain()` called for every spawned child |
| Lido stETH yield | `agent/src/lido.ts` — yield tracking + `StETHTreasury.sol` contract |
| Children are separate OS processes | `agent/src/swarm.ts` — `fork()` from Node.js `child_process` module, each child runs its own event loop |
| Parent kills misaligned children | `agent/src/swarm.ts` — `recallChild()` call when alignment score < 55 |
| 62/62 tests passing | `cd contracts && forge test` — verifiable locally or via `contracts/test/` |
| Yield withdrawal onchain | [StETHTreasury tx](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0xcc01d71508c53abe607bd96a0b6035c6a470eebd082200f3a775a7908db60d91) — agent withdrew yield, principal locked |

### What Venice E2EE is used for (6 distinct call types, all encrypted)

**Model: `llama-3.3-70b`** — Venice enables E2EE on all models. Every call runs through Venice's encrypted compute pipeline with `enable_e2ee: true`.

1. `summarizeProposal()` — extract key points from proposal before voting
2. `assessProposalRisk()` — evaluate treasury/centralization/alignment risk (low/medium/high/critical)
3. `reasonAboutProposal()` — decide FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN with detailed reasoning + keccak256 reasoning hash
4. `evaluateAlignment()` — parent scores child's voting record 0-100 against owner values
5. `generateSwarmReport()` — parent summarizes overall swarm health per cycle
6. `generateTerminationReport()` — parent explains WHY a child was killed for misalignment

Venice response header confirms `enable_e2ee: true` on every call. Usage metrics (tokens per call, cumulative totals) tracked and logged each evaluation cycle.
